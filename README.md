# ansible-role-resolver

Configures `/etc/resolv.conf`.

If DHCP client is running on the host, this role should not be used. Use
[ansible-role-dhclient](https://github.com/reallyenglish/ansible-role-dhclient)
instead.

## predictable_shuffle filter

`predictable_shuffle` shuffles a list, generates predictably shuffled list
given strings.

```
{{ list_of_ip_address | predictable_shuffle(ansible_fqdn) | list }}
```

# Requirements

None

# Role Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `resolver_nameservers` | list of resolvers | `[]` |

# Dependencies

None

# Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  pre_tasks:
    # XXX kill dhclient to ensure resolv.conf is never modified by it
    - shell: dhclient -x
      changed_when: false
      ignore_errors: true # so that "kitchen converge && kitchen converge" works
      when:
        - ansible_os_family == 'RedHat' or ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
    - shell: pkill dhclient
      when:
        - ansible_os_family == 'OpenBSD'
      changed_when: false
      ignore_errors: true
    - service:
        name: dhclient
        state: stopped
      changed_when: false
      ignore_errors: true
      when:
        - ansible_os_family == 'FreeBSD'

    # XXX ansible_fqdn is generally preferred to ansible_hostname to avoid
    # collision, but ansible_fqdn is generated by socket.getfqdn, which
    # returns different values when DNS servers are not available. as a list
    # of invalid DNS servers are used in the test, socket.getfqdn on OpenBSD
    # returns different value before and after the first play. use
    # ansible_hostname here to pass idempotency_test
    resolver_nameservers: "{{ nameservers | predictable_shuffle(ansible_hostname) | list }}"
